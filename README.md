# Citroen GSA Temperature System

### Simple temperature sensor for Citroen GSA based on DS18B20.

Citroen GSA is rare nowadays.
But some guy loves thems... like me !

So I just developped a small monitor system.
A sensor is placed outdoor, indoor and on the engine to monitor temperature while driving on the road.

A must have when this car is your daily...

## To use it :

1. Have DS18B20 and DS1307 and SH1106 128*64px
2. Install all sensors and screen on the Citroen GSA dashboard
3. Address correctly the sensor to the good values
4. Crank...... Let it get hotter and voilaaa!

// TODO

* Finish to dev the DS1307 clock
